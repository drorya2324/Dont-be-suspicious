  "Be careful! if you are still in <Night Vision Mode>, you cannot see it, but the camera is looking for you. switch back to <Dark Vision Mode> [R], and you'll see what I mean. Try to get to the next door without getting caught. Remember to get the combination from the computer!"

  "Great! But in this room there is a patrolling guard. try to collect the <Briefcase> without getting detected. Notice that there is a <Suspision Bar> in the top left corner of the screen. Once it's full- you'll get detected and fail the mission."
